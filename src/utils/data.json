      "As a graduate in Software Engineering from Kingston University, I am deeply passionate about applying the latest technologies and techniques in full-stack development and 3D game development. I have hands-on experience with React, React Native, Node.js, NestJS, Apollo GraphQL, and microservices, enabling me to create dynamic and responsive native applications that meet user needs and expectations.",
      "Previously, I worked as a 3D artist at Juego Studios Private Limited, where I contributed to the design and development of several 3D games across various platforms and genres. My creativity and skills in 3D modeling, texturing, lighting, and animation allowed me to create realistic and immersive game environments and characters. I also collaborated closely with the development team to ensure the games' optimal performance and quality. Additionally, during an internship at eClerx, I honed my skills in full-stack development, gaining practical experience with agile methodologies and a variety of software development tools, which has further strengthened my ability to build and maintain scalable applications."
